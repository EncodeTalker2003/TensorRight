  ( -- * TensorRight DSL
    --
    -- | We introduce a domain-specific language (DSL) for specifying tensor
    -- graph rewrites. The DSL contains constructs to define complex tensor
    -- expressions, specify preconditions, define rewrite rules, and verify
    -- them.

    -- * Language contructs

    -- ** @RClasses@

    -- | An @RClass@ represents a set of named axes.
    -- Every @RClass@ can be instantiated to an arbitrary number of individual-axes, and this set is kept uninterpreted/symbolic.
    -- Our language does not allow splitting of an @RClass@ into smaller @RClasses@,
    -- or adding named-axes to an @RClass@. This means that to operate on an
    -- @RClass@, the user needs to perform the same operation on every
    -- named-axis in it.
    --
    -- We can use 'newRClass' and 'newRClasses' to declare @RClasses@ in our language:

    -- | @
    --   rclass <- 'newRClass' "rclass"
    --   [rclass0, rclass1] <- 'newRClasses' ["rclass0", "rclass1"]
    -- @

    -- | This is written using Haskell's @do@ notation. 'newRClass' takes an @RClass@
    -- name and return an @RClass@ identifier corresponding to the @RClass@, while 'newRClasses'
    -- takes a list of @RClass@ names, and returns a list of @RClass@ identifiers,
    -- corresponding to those names. The returned identifiers can be used
    -- further in the code.

    -- ** Maps

    -- | As seen before, an @RClass@ is a symbolic set of named-axes. If we
    -- want to represent the sizes of named-axes in an @RClass@, we can use a
    -- map from those named-axes to their respective sizes.
    -- The domain of the map is the same as the named-axes in the @RClass@.
    -- Since @RClasses@ are symbolic in our DSL and are represented by 
    -- identifiers, these maps would also be symbolic and can be represented by identifiers.
    -- The maps can be instantiated to any number of named-axes in the @RClass@.
    --
    -- We can use the 'newMap' and 'newMaps' functions to declare maps on a
    -- given @RClass@ in our language:

    -- | @
    -- map <- 'newMap' "map" rclass
    -- [map1, map2] <- 'newMaps' ["map1, map2"] rclass
    -- @

    -- | 'newMap' takes a Map name and an @RClass@ identifier and returns a 
    -- @Map@ identifier, while 'newMaps' takes a list of names and returns a 
    -- list of @Map@ identifiers on the given @RClass@. A @Map@ identifier 
    -- represents a symbolic map, whose domain is the same as the named-axes in 
    -- an @RClass@.
    -- So, we can say in this example, that @dom(map) = rclass@.
    --
    -- The same map structure can also be used to represent operator attributes
    -- like slice strides, padding sizes, etc.

    -- *** Syntactic sugars for creating maps

    -- | Sometimes, we want to create a map with some constraints, like all the
    -- values in the map should be non-negative, or all the values should be
    -- constant. This can be achieved with preconditions (see below), but these 
    -- requirements are very common and using preconditions can be verbose. So, 
    -- we provide some syntax sugars for creating such maps:

    -- | @
    -- nonNeg <- 'newNonNegMap' "nonNeg" rclass
    -- constMap <- 'newConstMap' "constMap" 1 rclass
    -- @

    -- | In the code, the first line creates a map named @nonNeg@ on the given
    -- @RClass@, with the constraint that all the elements in the map should be
    -- non-negative. The second line creates a map named @constMap@ on the given
    -- rclass with all the elements in the map being constant 1.

    -- | We may also combine multiple maps into a single map, using the
    -- 'combineMap' call:

    -- | @
    -- summedMap <- 'combineMap' "summedMap" 'sum' [map1, map2]
    -- -- 'sumMap' is equivalent to 'combineMap' with 'sum' as the combining function
    -- summedMap <- 'sumMap' "summedMap" [map1, map2]
    -- @
    -- See 'TensorRight.combineMap' for more details.

    -- ** Tensor creation

    -- | To describe a tensor, we need to describe its shape first. A tensor
    -- comprises of a set of @RClasses@, possibly duplicated, where each @RClass@ has
    -- its own set of named-axes. A tensor's shape is supposed to tell the
    -- size of the tensor along every axis. We can describe the shape of a
    -- tensor as follows:
    --
    -- * For each @RClass@, we can use a @Map@ identifier to
    -- represent sizes of the named-axes in that @RClass@
    -- * The shape of tensor can be represented as a nested map from @RClass@ identifiers to @Map@ identifiers.
    --
    -- For example, we can create a tensor having two @RClasses@ @rclass0@ and
    -- @rclass0@ as follows:

    -- | @
    --
    -- [rclass0, rclass1] <- 'newRClasses' ["rclass0", "rclass1"]
    -- size0 <- 'newMap' "size0" rclass0
    -- size1 <- 'newMap' "size1" rclass1
    --
    -- let tensorShape = [rclass0 '-->' size0, rclass1 '-->' size1]
    --
    -- tensor <- 'newTensor' \@'TensorInt' "tensor" tensorShape
    -- @

    -- | We first declared two @RClass@ identifiers @rclass0@ and @rclass1@. Then, we
    -- declared @Map@ identifiers @size0@ and @size2@ on @rclass0@ and @rclass1@
    -- respectively. Then @tensorShape@ represents the shape of a tensor with 2
    -- @RClasses@ and the specified sizes. @rclass0 '-->' size0@ represents that
    -- @size0@ contains the sizes of named-axes in @rclass0@.
    --
    -- We then created a tensor using 'newTensor', which takes a name for the
    -- tensor, the base element type (in this case 'TensorInt') and the tensor
    -- shape. 'newTensor' returns a @Tensor@ identifier, which can be used to
    -- refer to this tensor in expressions. The created tensor is said to
    -- contain symbolic integer elements and is of shape @tensorShape@.

    -- *** Duplicate RClasses

    -- | We could have multiple copies of the same @RClass@ in a tensor's shape. For
    -- example, consider a tensor with 2 copies of @rclass0@

    -- | @
    -- rclass0 <- 'newRClass' "rclass0"
    -- [size, size'] <- 'newMaps' ["size", "size'"] rclass0
    -- let tensorShape = [rclass0 '-->' size, rclass0 '-->' size']
    -- tensor <- 'newTensor' \@'TensorInt' "tensor" tensorShape
    -- @

    -- | In such a case, if @rclass0@ had \(k\) named-axes, then the tensor has
    -- \(2k\) named-axes. Let's say we wanted to operate on this tensor, like
    -- reduce on one specific copy of @rclass0@.

    -- | @
    -- out <- 'reduce' tensor [rclass0 --\> ...]
    -- @

    -- | It is unclear in this expression, which copy of @rclass0@ gets reduced
    -- out -- is it the one with sizes @size@ or @size'@? To mitigate this
    -- issue, we allow the user to diambiguate duplicate @RClasses@ with labels,
    -- and use those labels to refer to a specific @RClass@. We use the '@@'
    -- syntax to specify labels while constructing tensor shapes.
    -- Labels are simply strings.

    -- | @
    -- let tensorShape = [rclass0 '-->' size '@@' "label0", rclass0 '-->' size' '@@' "label1"]
    -- tensor <- 'newTensor' \@'TensorInt' "tensor" tensorShape
    -- out <- 'reduce' tensor [(ByLabel "label1") --\> ...]
    -- @

    -- | Now, this expression is unambiguous and we can specify the @RClass@ to 
    -- reduce on by using an 'RClassRef' with the label @label1@.
    --
    -- Note that in a tensor's shapes, if an @RClass@ identifier appears multiple
    -- times, then all copies need to have a disambigutating label.
    -- Some examples are shown below:

    -- | @
    -- let tensorShapeValid =
    --       [
    --         rclass0 '-->' size '@@' "label0",
    --         rclass0 '-->' size' '@@' "label1",
    --         rclass0 '-->' size '@@' "label2"
    --       ]
    -- let tensorShapeInvalid =
    --       [
    --         rclass0 '-->' size '@@' "label0",
    --         rclass0 '-->' size'
    --       ]
    -- @

    -- | @tensorShapeValid@ is a valid shape, since all copies of @rclass0@ have a
    -- label, but the second shape is invalid. For the first shape, the user can
    -- refer to the @RClasses@ by @'ByLabel' "label0"@ for the first copy,
    -- @'ByLabel' "label1"@ for the second copy, and @'ByLabel' "label2"@
    -- for the third copy.

    -- | The user can omit labels in the case when no disambiguatation is needed.

    -- | @
    -- let tensorShapeValid =
    --       [
    --         rclass0 '-->' size0 '@@' "label0",
    --         rclass1 '-->' size1 '@@' "label1"
    --       ]
    -- let tensorShapeValid' =
    --       [
    --         rclass0 '-->' size0 '@@' "label0",
    --         rclass1 '-->' size1
    --       ]
    -- let tensorShapeValid'' =
    --       [
    --         rclass0 '-->' size0,
    --         rclass1 '-->' size1 
    --       ]
    -- @

    -- | All of these shapes are valid, but the only difference is that we need
    -- to use the label @label1@ to refer to @rclass1@ in the first shape (using 'ByLabel'), while
    -- in the second and third shape, we need to refer to it by @rclass1@ itself (using 'ByRClass'). Note that
    -- there was no need to specify labels here, because there are no duplicate
    -- @RClasses@, but we allow the user the flexibility to use labels.

    -- ** Tensor expressions

    -- | We will now describe the tensor operations supported in our DSL. @'Expr'@
    -- represents the type of a tensor expression. Refer to
    -- <https://github.com/ADAPT-uiuc/TensorRight/tree/master/rules>
    -- to take a look at concrete examples on how to instantiate tensor
    -- expressions.

    -- | For example, you may construct a tensor expression as follows:

    -- | @
    -- rclass <- 'newRClass' "rclass"
    -- map <- 'newMap' "map" rclass
    -- tensor <- 'newTensor' \@'TensorInt' "tensor" [rclass --\> map]
    -- expr <- 'numBinOp' 'Add' tensor tensor
    -- @

    -- | For the detailed list of operations supported, refer to the
    -- [operations]("TensorRight#g:op") section.

    -- ** Rewrite rules

    -- | A Rewrite rule consists of
    --
    -- * An LHS Tensor Expression
    -- * An RHS Tensor Expression
    -- * A set of preconditions (optional)
    -- * A set of si-relations (optional)
    --
    -- We saw in the previous section how we can construct tensor expressions.
    -- We will now look at contructs to specify preconditions, si-relations and
    -- rewrite rules.

    -- *** Preconditions

    -- | Preconditions are boolean (or symbolic boolean) valued conditions,
    -- under which the rewrite rule is supposedly correct. We can specify
    -- preconditions using the 'precondition' function. Its syntax is

    -- | @
    -- 'precondition' [m1, m2, ...] f
    -- @

    -- | where
    --
    -- * @[m1, m2, ...]@ is a list of @Map@ identifiers, all previously declared.
    --   It contains all the maps over which the precondition is
    --   defined
    -- * @f :: ['Grisette.SymInteger'] -> 'Grisette.SymBool'@ is a function, that takes a list of
    --   symbolic integers, and returns a symbolic boolean. The condition will 
    --   be applied to each group of the elements with the same axes and 
    --   combined with a logical AND to get the final symbolic boolean.
    --
    -- For example, we can write a precondition expressing that a maps needs to
    -- have all values as 0:

    -- | @
    -- rclass <- 'newRClass' "rclass"
    -- [size, padSize] <- 'newMap' ["size", "padSize"] rclass
    -- tensor <- 'newTensor' \@'TensorInt' "t" [rclass --\> size]
    -- lhs <- 'pad' tensor ('intElem' 0) $
    --   v'Padding'
    --     { low = [rclass '-->' padSize],
    --       interior = [rclass '-->' padSize],
    --       high = [rclass '-->' padSize]
    --     }
    -- 'precondition' [padSize] $ \[p] -> p .== 0
    -- @

    -- | The precondition first takes a list, containing only the @Map@ identifier
    -- @padSize@. It then takes a function, whose only argument is a
    -- singleton list containing the symbolic padding size and check if the 
    -- value is 0 or not. This function is applied to every axis in the map,
    -- and the final result checks if all values in @padSize@ are 0 or not.
    --
    -- The user can add multiple preconditions by using multiple calls to
    -- 'precondition'. The semantics are that the final precondition is the
    -- conjunction of all the individual preconditions.
    --
    -- For the constructs available to the user to express preconditions, please
    -- refer to the [preconditions]("TensorRight#g:precond") section and 
    -- functions 'TensorRight.precondition', 'TensorRight.precondition''.
    --
    -- Apart from the helpers provided there, some Grisette operators are also
    -- useful, like 'Grisette..==', 'Grisette.symIte', etc.

    -- *** SI-relations

    -- | The syntax to add si-relations is similar to preconditions -- we just
    -- need to use 'siRelation' instead of 'precondition'. For example, this
    -- si-relation expresses that rclass0lhssi == rclass0rhssi:

    -- | @
    -- 'siRelation' [rclass0lhssi, rclass0rhssi] $
    --   \[l, r] -> l .== r
    -- @
    -- Once all si-relations are declared, the user needs to call 'checkSIMap'
    -- and pass the list of all LHS si-maps and the list of all RHS si-maps.
    -- This tells TensorRight which @Map@ identifiers are si-maps.

    -- *** Rewrite rules

    -- | Once we have declared all @RClasses@, @Maps@,
    -- @Tensors@, created expressions and added preconditions, we can
    -- use the v'Rewrite' constructor to create a rewrite rule:

    -- | @
    -- lhs <- ...
    -- rhs <- ...
    -- return $
    --   v'Rewrite' "lhs => rhs" lhs rhs
    -- @

    -- | Here is a full example, that creates a rewrite rule, and wraps it in
    -- the appropriate context.

    -- | @
    -- rule :: 'DSLContext' t'Rewrite'
    -- rule = do
    --   rclass <- 'newRClass' "rclass"
    --   map <- 'newMap' "map" rclass
    --
    --   tensor <- 'newTensor' \@'TensorInt' "tensor" [rclass --\> map]
    --
    --   constTensor1 <- 'constant' \@'TensorInt' "a" [rclass --\> map]
    --   constTensor2 <- 'constant' \@'TensorInt' "b" [rclass --\> map]
    --   lhs <- 'numBinOp' 'Add' ('numBinOp' 'Add' tensor constTensor1) constTensor2
    --   rhs <- 'numBinOp' 'Add' tensor ('numBinOp' 'Add' constTensor1 constTensor2)
    --
    --   return $
    --     v'Rewrite' "Add(Add(A, Const), Const2) ⇒ Add(A, Add(Const, Const2))" lhs rhs
    -- @

    -- | Once this rule is declared, we can verify it using 'verifyDSL'.

    -- | @
    -- main :: IO ()
    -- main = 'verifyDSL' rule
    -- @

    -- ** Verification and debugging

    -- | We can verify the correctness of the DSL code using the 'verifyDSL'
    -- function.

    -- | Use 'verifyDSLWith' to pass additional options to the solver.

    -- | Use 'verifyNumDSL' to verify rules that only involve numeric types (integer and real).
    -- To use this function, the rewrite should have the type @forall a. 'NumRule' a@, and the user can use the type parameter @a@ to specify the type of the tensor as:

    -- | @
    -- rule :: forall a. 'NumRule' a
    -- rule _ = do
    --   ...
    --   tensor <- newTensor \@a "tensor" ...
    -- @

    -- | Use 'verifyAnyDTypeDSL' to verify rules for all types (integer, real, boolean).
    -- To use this function, the rewrite should have the type @forall a. 'AnyDTypeRule' a@, and the user can use the type parameter @a@ to specify the type of the tensor as:

    -- | @
    -- rule :: forall a. 'AnyDTypeRule' a
    -- rule _ = do
    --   ...
    --   tensor <- newTensor \@a "tensor" ...
    -- @

    -- | See the [verification]("TensorRight#g:verify") section for more details.

    -- | On failure, these functions will print various information. To help understand the
    -- failure better, we also provide a set of monitoring functions, which can
    -- be used to print the shapes of expressions, or the contents of maps, etc.
    -- on failure.
    --
    -- The following code monitors whether the lhs tensor is valid, and if valid
    -- monitors its shape. It also monitors the content of the @low@ map on
    -- failure.

    -- | @
    -- 'monitorExprOnFailure' "lhs" lhs
    -- 'monitorMapOnFailure' "low" (ByRClass spatial) low
    -- @

    -- * Differences from the Paper
    -- 
    -- | The TensorRight paper introduces aggregated-axes as a set of named-axes
    -- and RClasses as a property of a family of aggregated-axes, such that:
    --
    -- - Each aggregated-axes has exactly one RClass.
    -- - All aggregated-axes having the same RClass always have the same rank.
    --
    -- Meanwhile, in our DSL implementation, we introduce RClasses as a set of
    -- named-axes, and we allow duplicate RClasses in a tensor's shape. We also
    -- allow the user to label duplicate RClasses to disambiguate them.
    -- These labels play the role of aggregated-axes in case of labelled
    -- RClasses. Meanwhile, in the case of unlabelled RClasses, the RClasses
    -- themselves play the role of aggregated-axes.
    -- This is only a syntactic difference, and the semantics of the DSL
    -- implementation are the same as the paper.
